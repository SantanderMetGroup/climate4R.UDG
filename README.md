# climate4R.UDG

This package contains basic files and code for data access and harmonization of the User Data Gateway, an integration of [climate4R](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/climate4R) with the [Santander Climate Data Service (SCDS)](https://www.scds.es) THREDDS Data Server which provides user-friendly access to a variety of remote climate data sources. It is automatically loaded and works "under the hood" as part of the [loadeR](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/loadeR) package functionality. This service is maintained by the [Santander Meteorology Group](http://meteo.unican.es/en/main) (University of Cantabria - CSIC).
